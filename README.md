## API

The Tree View displays icons next to files. These icons are customizable by installing a package that provides an `atom.file-icons` service.

The `atom.file-icons` service must provide the following methods:

* `iconClassForPath(path)` - Returns a CSS class name to add to the file view
* `onWillDeactivate` - An event that lets the tree view return to its default icon strategy
